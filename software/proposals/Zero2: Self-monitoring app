**Zero2: Self-monitoring app**

A mobile app to support individuals in checking their health and provide insights to structure a more effective medical help system.

Note: COVID-19 self-diagnostics tools can provide false sense of security in people but we focus on creating predictive models and reducing the margin of errors.

**Problems** 

From interviews with italian COVID MDs and contribute from Helpful Engineering, we found out that:

Prioritisation framework based on severity of the problem (1mild, 5 high) and confidence in the ability to quickly create an accurate working solution (1low, 5 high).

**Data collection **



*   Oxygen saturation level
*   Temperature
*   Age
*   Location (approximate)
*   lasting health condition
*   Other Symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, chest pain

GDPR compliance no PII

**Medical evaluation**



*   sat 94% and above, lower chance of hypoxia 
*   sat 93-89% possible hypoxia consider notifying your PCP if having any of the following symptoms: cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain; 
*   Sat &lt; 89% probably hypoxia please notify your provider or seek emergency medical attention if having any of the following symptoms: cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain. 
*   drops by at least 3% during a short period in blood oxygen saturation is an alarm

No variation in Oxygen saturation level based on ethnicity

Oxygen saturation level decreases normally with age

Variation with sex?

Disclaimer: 

possible Covid-19 please notify hospital prior to arrival so appropriate measures can be taken

this is not a medically approved device and if having symptoms necessitating medical evaluation please seek medical attention or notifying your provider regardless of reading

**Feasibility initial study**

Build a mobile application that measures heart rate and blood oxygen saturation through use of mobile phone camera (some scientific validation: [[1, 2014]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5963704/?arnumber=5963704) [[2, 2015]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6959086) [[3, 2019]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30571649) [[4, 2020]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809420300847), code can be found [here](https://github.com/YahyaOdeh/HealthWatcher), APK to test [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxq6lYtmxVbtN0J6QklOdmRuZVU/view)).

Would be great if we have a working codebase to start with the working version [here](https://github.com/latinosamuel/HealthWatcher). For now, not accurate, we should e-mail authors of [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809420300847) for their code)

More research here: [https://app.slack.com/client/TUTSYURT3/threads/thread/CV83KNDV2-1584169197.458600](https://app.slack.com/client/TUTSYURT3/threads/thread/CV83KNDV2-1584169197.458600)

Advice could be given through a simple algorithm on the device or a restful API: Age + oxygen saturation maps linearly to the advice.

The oxygen saturation measurement + geo-data can be used to map spreading of symptoms globally. This can be combined with Google Maps data to understand outgoingness of people vs spreading of symptoms. \


**Extra Note:**

Pneumonia

[The authors of the Chinese CDC report divided the clinical manifestations of the disease by there severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/):



*   Mild disease: non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia; this occurred in 81% of cases.
*   Severe disease: dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio [the ratio between the blood pressure of the oxygen (partial pressure of oxygen, PaO2) and the percentage of oxygen supplied (fraction of inspired oxygen, FiO2)] &lt; 300, and/or lung infiltrates > 50% within 24 to 48 hours; this occurred in 14% of cases.
*   Critical disease: respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) or failure (MOF); this occurred in 5% of cases.[[12]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#)
